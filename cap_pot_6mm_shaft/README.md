there are both exported `.STL` files for direct printing and original freecad `.FCStd` design files that can be modified. included is the single pot and also 9x pots joined (for use at fab/print houses such as jlcpcb)

_NOTE if modifying model: these `.FCStd` files were created on __FreeCad v0.22.0dev__ and were showing errors when i tried opening in V1 - it may be a small fix but can be avoided if using that older version_
